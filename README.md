# Creating-Customer-Segments
In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer. So we used unsupervised clustering method - GMM. We determined to which cluster (customer segment) our data points belong: segment 0 represent restaurant (cafe) and segment 1 represent market.
Then we used a supervised learning technique (for example, SVM) with the customer product spending as an input datasets. As a target variable we used customer segments. After the classifier is trained the wholesale distributor could determine the most appropriate delivery service.
